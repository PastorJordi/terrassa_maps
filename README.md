# terrassa_maps
Gossiping my neighbours and plotting ~~sexy~~ maps

Here I'll store several visualizations related to my natal city
Also, I'll take it as an opportunity to practise markdown, [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) and [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

What I gathered so far:
- few maps about 2021-02-14 elections
- confinement in educational centers (under construction)
